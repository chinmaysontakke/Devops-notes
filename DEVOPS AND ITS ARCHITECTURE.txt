WHY DEVOPS:
To deliver application very speedly.

SDLC: software development lifecycle.

DEPLOYMENT: Process of installing application in server.




==========================================================================

SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES:
1. ONE-TIER 
2. TWO-TIER
3. THREE-TIER
4. N-TIER

TIER: SERVER: LAYER

SERVER: servers the services to the end user.
1. web server: 
2. app server:
3. db server:


WEB SERVER:
it is also called as the presentation layer.
to show the application.
who works: ui/ux developers
what they use: web technologies
ex: html, css, js

APP SERVER: 
To use the application.
also called the logic layer
who work: backend developers
what they use: programming
ex: java, python, c, c++, .net, go --------


DB SERVER:
It also called as db layer.
To store & retrieve data.
who work: db admins
what they use: db languages
ex: sql, oracle, postgres, arango ----

ONE-TIER ARCHITECTURE: STANDALONE APPLICATION
THE APP WILL WORK ON A LOCAL LAPTOP.
ALL LAYERS WILL BE ON LOCALLY.
IT WILL NOT REQ ANY INTERNET CONNECTION.
EX: VLC MEDIA PLAYER


TWO-TIER ARCHITECTURE: CLIENT-SERVER APPLICATION
THE APP WILL WORK ON A LOCAL LAPTOP.
LOCAL: PRESENTATION, LOGIC    DB: INTERNET 
IT WILL REQ ANY INTERNET CONNECTION.
EX: BANKING APPLICATIONS


THREE-TIER: WEB APPLICATION (REALTIME)
APPLICATION NO NEED TO BE ON LOCAL.
EVERYTHING WE CAN USE FROM THE INTERNET.
EX: WHATSAPP, YOUTUBE, INSTA -----


==========================================================

AGENDA: CREATE A WEBSERVER AND SHOW THE LIVE ENV 
SERVER: SERVER SERVS THE SERVICES TO END USER.
WEB SERVER: TO SHOW THE APPLICATION

TO CREATE SERVER WE NEED TO HAVE CLOUD ACCOUNT.
AWS: EC2 INSTANCES = ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD

TO CREATE EC2 WE NEED TO PERFORM 7 STEPS:

SERVER = COMPUTER
1. TAGS = NAME
2. AMI = OS, SOFTWARE PACKAGES
3. INSTANCE_TYPE = CPU & RAM
4. KEY_PAIR = LOGIN (public=aws, private=user)
5. NETWORK = VPC, SECURITY GROUPS (port numbers=0-65535)
6. STORAGE = 8 GB - 16 TB
7. SUMMARY = TO REVIEW 

SSH= SECURE SHELL (22) - TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS

===========================================================

OS = USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS.

TYPES:
1. WINDOWS
2. LINUX
3. MACOS

WHY TO USE LINUX:
SMART PHONE
SUPER COMPUTER
SMART WATCHES/TVS

ADVANTAGES:
1. FREE AND OPEN SOURCE
2. SECURITY
3. PERFOMANCE IS TOO GOOD.
4. MULTI USER BASED.
5. MULTI TASKING.

MODES:
1. GUI	: GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE
2. CLI	: COMMAND LINE INTERFACE

COMMANDS:
sudo -i		: to switch from ec2-user to root user
sudo su -	: to switch from ec2-user to root user
sudo su		: to switch from ec2-user to root user
logout (ctrl d)	: to switch from root to ec2-user
cat /proc/cpuinfo: to show cpu information
lscpu: to show cpu information
cat /proc/meminfo: to show memory information
lsmem: to show memory information
fdisk -l: to show the volume information
lsblk: to show the volume information
ifconfig/ ip addr/ ip addr show/ hostname -i: to show ip address
clear (ctrl l): to clear the screen
